### <a name="Crafting"></a>Crafting

To craft the grappling gun, three sub-parts must be crafted first:

Hook: 5 iron ingots

Barrel: 6 iron ingots, 3 strings

Stock: 1 flint and steel, 1 gunpowder, 2 iron ingots, 1 string, 2 wood

Now the gun itself can be crafted from the three parts:

### <a name="Building"></a>Building

To build a bridge, fire the grappling gun just like you would a regular bow. When aiming the grappling gun (right-click), the player's view is zoomed in and directed in line with a cardinal direction.

Upon release the bridge is built if possible.

The bridge won't build if:
- There is something in the way (get's marked with smoke particles)
- The bridge is too steep
- The required materials are not present in the player's inventory

If something goes wrong, a promt will let you know what the problem is and how to fix it. If everything checks out, the bridge will be built from slabs and string found in the inventory.
