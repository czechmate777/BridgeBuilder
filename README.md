# BridgeBuilder
### The Rope-Bridge mod for Minecraft 1.8.x
Rope-Bridge is a simple mod that assists players in constructing rope bridges.
For now the mod features the following:
-   Craftable "Bridge Builder" tool
-   Simiple selection system
-   Building animations
-   Detection for blicks that are in the way
-   Custom bridge slab

### How to use
To craft the Bridge Builder tool, assemble 6 leads and 3 logs as shown. The Bridge Builder can also be found under the creative inventory tab "Tools".

Once obtained, begin using the tool by right-clicking on your first block you wish to start the bridge from. Click same block again to cancel.

You may then chose a second anchor point for the bridge by right-clicking on another block. If all goes well, the bridge will be built.

Sometimes there is somehting in the way of the bridge you want to build. If so, the blocks will be marked with smoke particles.

Make sure your bridge isn't too steep!

That's it!

I hope you enjoy this mod and please don't hesitate to give me ideas for how to improve it.

### To Do:
- Break whole bridge when using Bridge Builder
- Sounds
- Make material like wood so axes can easily break slabs
- Make the Builder take damage over time
